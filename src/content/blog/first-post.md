I have always wanted a personal website and I have put off building one for way too long. Welcome to my site! Here I plan to share updates about my life and share my journey as an entrepreneur with you. I am currently in the process of building my first startup, <a href="https://buildwithbridge.ai"> Bridge</a>. Follow along as I share my insights and lessons learned along the way!

This is also the perfect place for me to nerd out about my interests and dive deep into the things I obsess over. Just a sample of what you can expect here:
```markdown
- Sneaker rotations
- Desk setups
- Races I think are cool but will never sign up for
- Expensive things I will never buy
- Obsidian workflows 
- AI optimism
- Extensive gear lists
- Design details that only Steve Jobs would care about
- so much more

```
Thanks for stopping by! I'm happy to have you here. Feel free to reach out to me on X @connormccoy_ if you want to connect.

It's been a while since I've made an update here. I'll be spending the next few weeks posting a backlog of blog posts, essays, and thoughts from the past few months. Here is what I've been up to lately:

### Applied to YC F25
I applied for the YC spring batch earlier this year and I was not accepted. I put the application together in a rush and sent it out before I had really even built anything. My cofounder quit a week after I submitted the application. So I was left with no cofounder, no product, and no users. A month later, my rejection email came in, but I was already working on the next application. 

I got in touch with a friend from middle school who is a CS student at BYU, and brought him on as a cofounder for Bridge. We have since made significant progress from the last application. Over the past few weeks, we have been working hard at putting together an MVP, and securing our first customer. 

It's been a long process, filled with uncertainty and a lot of improvising. We have learned a lot along the way, and we will continue to learn more as we gain a better understanding of our users, and the problems they face.
